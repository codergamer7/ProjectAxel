## Script contribution guide
Script contribution is relatively easy.

### Scripts.json
If you wish to contribute scripts, simply edit [https://github.com/MainDabRblx/ProjectDab/blob/master/UpdateStuff/Scripts.json](https://github.com/MainDabRblx/ProjectDab/blob/master/UpdateStuff/Scripts.json) and create a pull request. Make sure you follow the .json format.

### Can I touch anything else here?
No, it's pretty irrelevant.
