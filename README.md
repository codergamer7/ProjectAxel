## MainDab Files
Here are where all files for MainDab are placed. There's no other alternative platform I could really think of and moving to another website is too risky, so I'd imagine this is the best place to put stuff.

### Theme contribution
Please see the [theme contribution guide](https://github.com/MainDabRblx/ProjectDab/tree/master/UIThemes "theme contribution guide").

### Script Hub contribution
Please see the [script contribution guide](https://github.com/MainDabRblx/ProjectDab/tree/master/UpdateStuff "script contribution guide").

### Folders
All these folders are for seperate stuff, which I'll briefly explain :
- The ExtraApplications folder are for plugin applications
- The ScriptStorage folder are for keep scripts needed by the script hub
- The Themes folder are for the AvalonEdit themes (text editor)
- The UIThemeImages folder are for the themes images themselves, self explanatory
- The UIThemes are where the .json files for the themes are kept
- The UpdateStuff are where the most important MainDab files are kept , those being
	- The changelog
	- The Discord link 
	- The notice board text 
	- The .json scripthub listing
	- The .json theme listing 
	- The current MainDab version, which MainDab checks on startup

Everything else are just other files that MainDab needs or the user downloads. MainDab is a standalone application, meaning that you can simply download MainDab.exe and expect it to work. This is done by packing all the dependencies.
